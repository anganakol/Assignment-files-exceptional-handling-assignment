What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n","\n","ans- Compiled Languages:\n","      The source code is translated into machine code (executable) by a compiler before execution.\n","        Examples: C, C++, Java (bytecode is compiled to machine code)\n","        Typically faster execution as the machine code is optimized for the specific hardware.\n","Interpreted Languages:\n","      The source code is executed line by line by an interpreter.\n","        Examples: Python, JavaScript, Ruby\n","        More flexible and easier to debug, but generally slower than compiled languages.\n","\n","2. What is exception handling in Python?\n","\n","ans- Exception handling is a mechanism in Python that allows us to gracefully handle unexpected events or errors that occur during program execution. It helps prevent our program from crashing and provides a way to recover from errors or take appropriate actions.\n","\n","3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n","\n","ans- The finally block is used to define code that will be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It's often used for cleanup tasks like closing files, releasing resources1 (database connections, network sockets), or restoring the program to a consistent state.\n","\n","4. What is logging in Python?\n","\n","ans- Logging is a system for recording events that occur within a program. It helps in debugging, monitoring, and troubleshooting by providing a record of what happened during program execution. The logging module in Python provides a flexible and powerful way to implement logging in our applications.\n","\n","5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","\n","ans- The __del__ method, also known as the destructor, is a special method that gets called when an object is about to be garbage collected. It's used for any necessary cleanup operations before the object is destroyed, such as closing files or releasing external resources.\n","\n","6. What is the difference between import and from...import in Python?\n","\n","ans- import: Imports the entire module into the current namespace. We would then access its members using the module name as a prefix (e.g., module_name.function_name, module_name.class_name).\n","      from...import: Imports specific members (functions, classes, variables) from a module directly into the current namespace. We can then use them without the module name prefix.\n","\n","7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n","\n","ans- We can use multiple except blocks to handle different types of exceptions:\n","\n","try:\n","except TypeError:\n","except ValueError:\n","except Exception:\n","\n","8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n","\n","ans- The with statement ensures that a file is properly closed even if exceptions occur within the block. It automatically calls the close() method on the file object when the block is exited.\n","\n","9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing in Python?\n","\n","ans- Multithreading: Creates multiple threads within a single process. Threads share the same memory space, making communication between them easier but also introducing potential for race conditions and deadlocks.\n","\n","Multiprocessing: Creates multiple processes, each with its own memory space. This provides better isolation and avoids some of the issues associated with multithreading, but communication between processes is more complex.\n","\n","10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n","\n","ans- Debugging, Monitoring, Auditing, Troubleshooting.\n","\n","11. What are memory management in Python?\n","\n","ans- Memory management in Python is primarily handled by the Python interpreter using a garbage collector. The garbage collector automatically reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer referenced by the program.\n","\n","12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n","\n","ans- try, except, finally.\n","\n","13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n","\n","ans- Efficient memory management is crucial for program performance and stability. It prevents memory leaks (where unused memory is not released), which can lead to slowdowns and eventually cause the program to crash.\n","\n","14. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n","\n","ans- Python uses a garbage collector (typically a reference counting system) to automatically reclaim memory occupied by objects that are no longer referenced by any part of the program. When an object's reference count reaches zero, it is considered garbage and is automatically collected by the garbage collector.\n","\n","15. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n","\n","ans- The else block is executed if no exceptions occur within the try block. It's useful for code that should only run if the try block completes successfully without any errors.\n","\n","16. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n","\n","ans- DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL\n","\n","17. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n","\n","ans- os.fork() is a system call that creates a child process. It's a lower-level mechanism for creating new processes.\n","The multiprocessing module provides a higher-level API for creating and managing processes, making it easier to work with multiple processes in Python.\n","\n","18. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n","\n","ans- Closing a file releases the system resources associated with the file, such as the file handle. If a file is not closed properly, it can lead to resource leaks, which can negatively impact the performance and stability of the program.\n","\n","19. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n","\n","ans- file.read() reads the entire contents of the file as a single string.\n","file.readline() reads a single line from the file as a string.\n","\n","20. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n","\n","ans- Closing a file releases the system resources associated with the file, such as the file handle. If a file is not closed properly, it can lead to resource leaks, which can negatively impact the performance and stability of the program.\n","\n","21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n","\n","ans- The logging module is used for creating and managing log records. It provides a flexible and powerful way to record events that occur within a program for debugging, monitoring, and troubleshooting.\n","\n","22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n","\n","ans- The os module provides functions for interacting with the operating system, including file and directory operations. It can be used for tasks like creating, renaming, deleting, and navigating files and directories.\n","\n","23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n","\n","ans- 1. Memory leaks: Unreferenced objects that are not garbage collected can consume memory and lead to performance issues.\n","2. Circular references: When objects reference each other, the garbage collector might not be able to detect and reclaim them.\n","3. Large datasets: Handling large amounts of data can put a strain on memory resources.\n","\n","24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n","\n","ans- We can raise an exception using the raise statement followed by the exception object.\n","\n","25. Why is it important to handle multithreading in certain applications?\n","\n","ans- Multithreading can improve the performance of applications that can be divided into multiple concurrent tasks. It can make better use of CPU resources and improve responsiveness, especially in I/O-bound applications.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"KcrXIoh8p7rZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Practical Questions"],"metadata":{"id":"ArBRDN8OuOyz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.
